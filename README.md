# Creating-VPC-and-Subnets-Using-AWS-CLI
Creating a virtual private cloud (VPC) is a great way to keep your AWS resources isolated from the rest of the world.
I created a VPC and two subnets in this project using AWS CLI. The subnets consisted of both a public subnet and a private subnet. I created an internet gateway and attached it to the VPC.
I then created a route table and assigned it to the public subnet. This allowed me to access the internet from our VPC.
The code for this project is available in the folders above, along with a diagram of the VPC architecture.
